# 2. create the RetrieveUserProxyAgent instance named "ragproxyagent"
# By default, the human_input_mode is "ALWAYS", which means the agent will ask for human input at every step. We set it to "NEVER" here.
# `docs_path` is the path to the docs directory. It can also be the path to a single file, or the url to a single file. By default,
# it is set to None, which works only if the collection is already created.
# `task` indicates the kind of task we're working on. In this example, it's a `code` task.
# `chunk_token_size` is the chunk token size for the retrieve chat. By default, it is set to `max_tokens * 0.6`, here we set it to 2000.
# `custom_text_types` is a list of file types to be processed. Default is `autogen.retrieve_utils.TEXT_FORMATS`.
# This only applies to files under the directories in `docs_path`. Explicitly included files and urls will be chunked regardless of their types.
# In this example, we set it to ["mdx"] to only process markdown files. Since no mdx files are included in the `websit/docs`,
# no files there will be processed. However, the explicitly included urls will still be processed.
